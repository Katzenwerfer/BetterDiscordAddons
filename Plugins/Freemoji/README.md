# Freemoji

Using this plugin you can send emoji from other server and animated emotes without having Nitro. This works by automatically replacing selected emoji with their corresponding image link.

Even it even works for animated emoji. Because it's sending an image link it won't work mid-sentence or for sending multiple emoji at once. But for single emote messages it's almost much seemless, just the size is slightly different.

This plugin is adapted from FreeEmojis by [An00nymushun](https://github.com/An00nymushun). It adds an size setting in the plugin settings and will also automatically remove the grayscale filter from emoji that would you usually wouldn't be able to use.
