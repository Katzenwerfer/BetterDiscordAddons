# Freemoji ([Download](https://mwittrien.github.io/downloader/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QbDesu/BetterDiscordAddons/potato/Plugins/Freemoji/Freemoji.plugin.js))

Using this plugin you can send emoji from other server and animated emotes without having Nitro.

This plugin is an adapted form of the late NitroPerks plugin. Everything but it's emoji features were stripped out and won't be added back in.
