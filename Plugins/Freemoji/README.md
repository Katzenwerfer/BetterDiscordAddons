# Freemoji

Using this plugin you can send emoji from other server and animated emotes without having Nitro. This works by automatically replacing selected emoji with their corresponding image link.

This plugin is an adapted form FreeEmojis by [An00nymushun](https://github.com/An00nymushun). It adds an size setting in the plugin settings and will also automatically remove the grayscale filter from emoji that would you usually wouldn't be able to use.
