It's configurable whether the popout should appear when right-clicking or left-clicking.

This plugin is losely based on [AccountDetailsPlus](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/AccountDetailsPlus) by [Zerebos](https://github.com/rauenzi), and ended up having quite a similar structure. But has been rewritten from scratch to be more compatible with other plugins.
