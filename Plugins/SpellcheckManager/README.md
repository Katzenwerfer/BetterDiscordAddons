# SpellcheckManager

This a very simple [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) plugin that allows removing learned words from Discord's spellchecker dictionary.  
Simply enable the plugin and open it's settings menu to remove the entries.

So even if it's completely functional it's also meant as a joke, as well as for testing [bdbuilder](https://github.com/BetterDiscordBuilder/bdbuilder/).
