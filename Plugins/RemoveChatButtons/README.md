# RemoveChatButtons

This plugin allow you to hide all those annoying Chat Buttons that always bothered you.  
Gift button? Begone! Sticker button? Begone!  
GIF button? I actually quite like that one, so I configured the plugin to keep it.  
But you can choose which buttons to hide and which to keep. Simply go to the plugin settings.
